***FEATURES***
Auto update window when? 
Debug logs should be saved in files, and shown on screen when needed
Debug coordinate values that show range (not value) when you're at a specific location
____*
    | system for id'ing a point
    |
of course a shell
one should be able to call this program from command line
notifications, for when a stock price goes above/below a certain limit


\/\/\/Under the hood\/\/\/
Change the vector of OHLC tuples to a vector of OHLC+T values
for the love of all things holy add a coordinate point class
enums for autolabel formatting 
Reorganize files (api/, label.cpp)
find a better name than extra.cpp for program wide functions 

When adding a label using autolabel, save the x axis positions
So that if the label needs to be updated later it can.
maybe? split x autolabel into two functions:
   one for finding x coordinate points for labeling
   (resulting in a vector of points+what values they represent)

   One for filling in labels with actual points
